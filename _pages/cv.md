## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

### Development of cell-free RNA (cfRNA) Sequencing Bioinformatics Pipeline | Dec 2022 – Jun 2023
*   **Goal:** To establish an optimized bioinformatics workflow for analyzing cfRNA data while collaborating with the experimental team on the development of the novel in-house library preparation method.
*   **Methods:** Evaluated and integrated bioinformatics tools (e.g., STAR, Samtools, DESeq2, FASTP, featureCounts, seqkt, bbduk); Defined QC metrics; Critically analyzed sequencing data from iterative technology optimization trials, providing timely feedback to guide protocol refinement;
*   **Outcome:** Successfully developed and deployed a customized cfRNA analysis pipeline used in subsequent research.

### cfRNA Transcriptome & Fragment Analysis in a Natural Population Cohort | May 2023 – Oct 2023
*   **Goal:** To characterize the plasma cfRNA landscape and identify potential health monitoring biomarkers.
*   **Methods:** Applied a self-developed pipeline for end-to-end analysis including data processing, characterization of diverse cfRNA features (composition, size, origins via deconvolution), and assessment of individual variance for potential health monitoring signatures.
*   **Outcome:** Contributed key bioinformatics analyses characterizing diverse cfRNA profiles and their health monitoring potential, resulting in a co-first author publication in RNA Biology.

### cfDNA Fragmentomics in Pregnant Women's Plasma | Jan 2024 – Oct 2024
*   **Goal:** To systematically evaluate the impact of WGBS on cfDNA fragmentomic features compared to WGS.
*   **Methods:** Utilized Linux tools, Shell scripting, and R for comparative analysis of fragment size distributions, end-motif patterns, coverage of Key sites (TSS/CTCF) of transcriptional regulation, GC bias, and fetal fraction estimation between paired WGS and WGBS datasets. Developed custom analysis scripts.
*   **Outcome:** Led the bioinformatics analysis and contributed significantly to manuscript writing, resulting in a first-author publication in Clinica Chimica Acta.
