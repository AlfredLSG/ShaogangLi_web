## About me

I'm a Master's student from [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/) (Joint Program with [BGI Research](https://en.genomics.cn/)). My research focuses on **cell-free nucleic acid (cfDNA/cfRNA) analysis**, specializing in **fragmentomics**, **bioinformatics pipeline development**, and **genomics/transcriptomics data analysis** for applications in liquid biopsy and early disease detection.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Dr. Haiqiang Zhang and Prof. Xin Jin at BGI Research. My work has led to significant contributions, including **two co-first authored SCI Q2 publications**.
